## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Claude Code

When using Claude Code, ALWAYS tell it:
```
I'm building Momentum. Read these docs first:
- CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md
- DANGER_ZONES.md  
- STATE_SNAPSHOT.md
- FAILURE_LOG.md

Current task: [describe what you're building]
```

This will prevent 90% of Claude Code mistakes!
