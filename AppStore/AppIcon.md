## Implementation Steps

1. **Design in Vector**
   - Create in Figma/Sketch/Illustrator
   - Work at 1024 × 1024
   - Keep source files organized

2. **Export Process**
   - Export as PNG
   - No compression
   - Verify no transparency
   - Check color profile (sRGB)

3. **Xcode Integration**
   - Drag to Assets.xcassets
   - Let Xcode generate all sizes
   - Verify each size looks correct
   - Test on real devices

4. **App Store Assets**
   - Keep original 1024 × 1024 for upload
   - May need alternate for marketing
   - Consider seasonal variations

## Alternative Icons (Future)

Consider providing alternative icons users can choose:
- Dark mode variant
- Seasonal themes
- Premium/Pro version
- Celebration icons for milestones

These require:
- Adding to Info.plist
- CFBundleAlternateIcons configuration
- All sizes for each variant
