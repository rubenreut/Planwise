# Missing Parameters Fix Summary

## Issue
After extending `updateEvent` and `updateTask` methods to support all fields, there were 9 compilation errors in ChatViewModel where existing calls weren't passing all the new required parameters.

## Root Cause
When we updated the protocols and implementations to support comprehensive field updates, we made all parameters required (no default values in the protocol). This broke existing calls that were only updating a subset of fields.

## Fixes Applied

### updateEvent Calls (4 locations fixed)
1. **Line 2056** - `updateEvent` function: Added all missing parameters (colorHex through linkedTasks) as nil
2. **Line 2659** - `updateMultipleEvents`: Added missing linkedTasks parameter
3. **Line 2773** - Another location in bulk update: Added all missing parameters as nil  
4. **Line 3256** - `moveEventsToDate`: Added all missing parameters as nil

### updateTask Calls (5 locations fixed)
1. **Line 3806** - `updateTask` function: Added linkedEvent and parentTask as nil
2. **Line 4068** - `scheduleTaskForEvent`: Added linkedEvent (set to event) and parentTask as nil
3. **Line 4299** - `updateMultipleTasks`: Added linkedEvent and parentTask as nil
4. **Line 4666** - Another bulk update location: Added linkedEvent and parentTask as nil
5. **Line 4842** - `rescheduleTasks`: Added linkedEvent and parentTask as nil

## Solution Pattern
For all existing calls that don't need the new fields, we pass `nil` for the additional parameters:
```swift
// Before (error)
scheduleManager.updateEvent(event, title: "New Title", startTime: date, ...)

// After (fixed)
scheduleManager.updateEvent(
    event, 
    title: "New Title", 
    startTime: date,
    ...,
    colorHex: nil,
    iconName: nil,
    priority: nil,
    tags: nil,
    url: nil,
    energyLevel: nil,
    weatherRequired: nil,
    bufferTimeBefore: nil,
    bufferTimeAfter: nil,
    recurrenceRule: nil,
    recurrenceEndDate: nil,
    linkedTasks: nil
)
```

## Alternative Approach (Not Used)
Could have added default parameter values in the protocol extension, but this would require careful consideration of protocol design and might hide important update capabilities from callers.

## Result
✅ All 9 compilation errors fixed
✅ App builds successfully
✅ Existing functionality preserved while supporting comprehensive field updates
